A CSS visualizer that allows users to see how CSS properties are applied to DOM elements using animations.

How it works
-------------

When a user clicks on the 'play' button, an animation timeline is triggered that applied CSS properties to the specified DOM element in sequential order.

The user has control over the animation queue and has the options to 'pause', take the 'next' step, or go 'back' a step in the timeline. Additionally, the user may click on an individual property to bring the animation back to a specific state.
